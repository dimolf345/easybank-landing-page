## My process

In order to build this project I followed the guid on CSS tricks [A step-by-step process for turning designs into code](https://css-tricks.com/a-step-by-step-process-for-turning-designs-into-code/), and indeed it helped me a lot.
Moreover, I wanted to focus for the first time my attention on improving web accessibility. I studied both the WCAG tutorials available on the official website and also Used a very pragmatic [guide made by Kitty Giraudel](https://kittygiraudel.com/2020/12/01/a11y-advent-calendar/).
It has been an amazing topic to study.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup with BEM naming convention
- SASS
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I trained my ability to write down by hand all the considerations and notes about the project BEFORE starting to write code. So I first decided what kind of basic approach to start with (desktop first instead of mobile first), considering the design provided.
Then I started to take note of how to identify each main element of the page layout, such as the navbar, the three sections, the card containers, the footer, ecc...
After having a clear picture of the page layout, I started to write down variables and to evaluate which components of the page could be reusable (such as the "Request Inviste" btn).
Once finished the desktop version, I started to shrink down the viewport width in order to understand which breakpoints to implement.

I think I've done a good job, I put a lot of effort in, so please leave me a comment.

### Continued development

Next project I will follow again the same process with an harder page, implementing also Third Party Libraries such as Bootstrap. I will also continue to commit myself in order to make my web pages more accessible.
